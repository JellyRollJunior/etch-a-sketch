- Creates a grid of squares using Javascript that change color on mouseover
- Resize button:
  - Prompts user for grid size
  - If grid size is valid, remove current grid and create new grid of specified number of squares
  - Grid size (in pixels) remains the same no matter the number of squares
- Reset button:
  - Removes highlighting from all grid squares

## Learning outcomes
